# UK LSOA / DZ / SDZ Classification (2021/2 LSOAC) - Lincolnshire LSOAs

The **2021/2 UK Output Area Classification for Lower Layer Super Output Areas (2021/2 LSOAC)** is a 3-tier hierarchical geodemographic classification developed from the 2021 Census of England & Wales (and Scottish Data Zones / Northern Ireland Super Data Zones). It identifies areas with similar social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics.

This dataset has been filtered and enriched for all **435 Lower Layer Super Output Areas (2021 LSOAs)** within Lincolnshire.
